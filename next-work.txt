Yes, you can add a dropdown to select the user role (Doctor, Nurse, Patient) and a sample user name.
You can then control access so that:

Only the doctor who reviewed a report, the patient who submitted it, and nurses assigned to that doctor can view the decrypted data.
How this can work (sample logic):

When submitting, the patient selects their name.
When reviewing, the doctor selects their name.
When a nurse logs in, they select their name and the doctor they work under.
Each encrypted file is tagged with metadata (e.g., patient name, doctor name).
Only authorized users (doctor, patient, nurse under that doctor) can decrypt and view the data.
Iâ€™ll update your UI to demonstrate this logic with dropdowns and simple access control for demo purposes
